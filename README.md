# Tensorflow-motorcycle-cycle-detector
This is a simple AI model for detecting motorcycle and cycle. I used tensorflow inception model and retrain the model with my own datasets. It can detect motor cycle and cycle above 90% accuracy.
</br>Some link that's help to build this model
</br> - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
</br> - [Microcontrollersandmore Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/18F4550videos/videos)

</br>Datasets:
</br>Motor Cycles from [Google](www.google.com)
</br>Mountainbikes from Microcontrollerandmore tutorial
# To Use this model
Install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and run the **_retrain.py_** first. It will retrain with your data. Then run the **_test.py_** it will test with test_images
show you output with images.
